## Hi there 👋, I'm Daniel!:


- 👨‍🎓 I'm a full-stack developer and Flatiron School graduate with a passion for building dynamic web applications using React, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.
- 👨‍💻 I leverage my background in music and technology to create engaging user experiences, but I'm equally excited about tackling challenges across industries like healthcare, advertising, entertainment, and finance.
- 🔭 Currently, I'm expanding my full-stack skills by developing projects that showcase clean UI design, RESTful APIs, and robust database integrations.
- 💼 Open to software engineering roles with a focus on frontend, backend, or full-stack development.
